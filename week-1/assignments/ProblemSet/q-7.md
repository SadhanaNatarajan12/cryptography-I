<b>Suppose you are told that the one time pad encryption of the message "attack at dawn" is <code>6c73d5240a948c86981bc294814d </code><br>
(the plaintext letters are encoded as 8-bit ASCII and the given ciphertext is written in hex). <br>
What would be the one time pad encryption of the message "attack at dusk" under the same OTP key?</b>
<br>
<br>
Answer:- <br>
Understand the explanation and run the Python code. You'll get the answer. I used Python 2.7 with Git.

Easier to solve this problem if you had already solved <a href="https://github.com/ashumeow/cryptography-I/tree/master/week-1/assignments/_ExtraCredit">extra-credits</a> assignment.
```py
def strxor(a, b):
    if len(a) > len(b):
        return "".join([chr(ord(x) ^ ord(y)) for (x, y) in zip(a[:len(b)], b)])
    else:
        return "".join([chr(ord(x) ^ ord(y)) for (x, y) in zip(a, b[:len(a)])])
 
def random(size=16):
    return open("/dev/urandom").read(size)
 
def encrypt(key, msg):
    c = strxor(key, msg)
    print
    print c.encode('hex')
    return c
 
def printAscii(msg):
    z = [chr(ord(x)) for x in msg] 
    x = "".join(z)
    print x.encode('hex')
 
def main():
    text = "attack at dawn"
    enc = "6c73d5240a948c86981bc294814d".decode('hex')
    key = strxor(text, enc)
    text2 = "attack at dusk"
    enc2 = strxor(text2, key)
    print enc2.encode('hex')
```
Above code is almost 100% answer... <br>
<code>Using only Python 2.7 ---</code>
```
>>> import py_compile
>>> py_compile.compile('crypto-1/ig.py')
>>> execfile("crypto-1/ig.py")
```
<code>Using Python 2.7 with Git ---</code>

$ python.exe crypto-1/ig.py
