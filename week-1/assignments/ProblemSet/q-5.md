<b>Let M=C=K={0,1,2,…,255} and consider the following cipher defined over (K,M,C):  <br>
		<code>E(k,m)=m+k(mod256) ; D(k,c)=c−k(mod256)</code><br>
Does this cipher have perfect secrecy?</b><br>
<br><i>Pick any one... <br>
(i) No, only the One Time Pad has perfect secrecy.<br>
(ii) No, there is a simple attack on this cipher.<br>
(iii) Yes.
</i>
<br>
<br>
Answer:- (iii) Yes<br>
<br>
Explanation:-<br>
```
M is message, C is cipher and K is key

E: K X M -> C --------> (1) [refer [1]]

This can also be expressed as,
[E(K, M) = C]

Given,
E(K,M)=M+K(mod256) -----> (2)
```

Method 1:-
```
Using (1) with (2),
=> K(mod256) * M = C 
=> M(mod256) - C = 1/K
=> 256 - C = 1/K --- [refer[2] under RC4]
=> K(256 - C)= 1
=> To get K ==> C = 1/256
It's difficult to crack C inorder to get K
So, the cipher (C) has perfect secrecy.
```

Method 2:-
```
Using (1)
E: K X M -> C
Including (2) with (1),
K X M = M + K(mod256)
1 = (M + K(mod256)) / (K X M)
1 = (M + K(mod256)) / KM
1 - M = K(mod256) / KM
1 - M = (mod256)/M
1 = M + (mod256)/M
1 = (M + mod256) / M --- [refer[2] under RC4]
1 = 256
=> 1/256

It's difficult to crack C.
So, the cipher (C) has perfect secrecy.
