<b>Let G:{0,1}^s→{0,1}^n be a secure PRG. Which of the following is a secure PRG (there is more than one correct answer):</b><br>
<i>
(i) G′(k)=G(k)⊕1^n <br>
(ii) G′(k)=G(k)∥∥G(k)     (here ∥∥ denotes concatenation) <br>
(iii) G′(k)=G(0) <br>
(iv) G′(k)=G(k)[0,…,n−2]     (i.e., G′(k) drops the last bit of G(k)) <br>
(v) G′(k)=G(k)∥∥0     (here ∥∥ denotes concatenation) <br>
(vi) G′(k)=G(k⊕1^s) 
</i><br>
<br>
Answer:- <br>
(ii) G′(k)=G(k)∥∥G(k) <br>
(iv) G′(k)=G(k)[0,…,n−2] <br>
(vi) G′(k)=G(k⊕1^s)  <br>
<br>
Explanation:-<br>
(i) is not secure since XOR-ing {0,1}^n with 1^n is possible to predict, where G(K) => {0,1}^n <br>
refer <code>notes-6 under stream ciphers</code><br>
(ii) Concatenation of G(K) and G(K) for G:K is secure. <br>
(iii) is not secure. <code>refer [1] under notes-9</code><br>
(iv) is secure, refer [1] under <code>notes-9 under Secure PRGs part-4</code> -- Yao's theorem. <br>
(v) is not secure, because it is possible to predict G:K = G(K) and concatenating with 0 is possible to predict. <br>
Refer [1] under <code>notes-9 evaluation of statistical tests</code>. <br>
(vi) is secure. Refer [1] under <code>notes-6 in eStream</code>.
