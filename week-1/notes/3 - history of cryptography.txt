Crypto stuffs---
"The code breakers" -- David Kahn (1996)

Then...same thingy is repeated over and over..
Symmetric ciphers.. explaining how message transferred..
refer [notes 1 & 2], okay ashu? =)
Encryption formula:-
c:=E(k,m)
Decryption formula:-
m:=D(k,c)

Historical Examples:- (*_*)
(1) Substitution cipher
k:=a->i,...h->y...,s->l,...u->a...z->g
c:=E(k,"ig")="az"
m:=D(k,"az")="ig"

Caesar cipher (no key)
-- Fixed substitution
Eg:- shift by 3, (i.e.)k=3
=> the alphabets in the message gets shifted by 3 alphabets
=> For eg:- ashu => dvkx => ashu

what is the size of key space in the substitution cipher assuming 26 letters?
Answer:- |k| = 26! (26 factorial)
A substitution cipher is a table of 26 permutations
26! => 2^88, where each key is represented by 88 bits.

How to break a substitution cipher?
(i) Usage of frequent english alphabets
e => 12.7%
t => 9.1%
a => 8.1%
(ii) Usage of frequent english pairs
"he", "an", "in", "th"

(2) Vigener cipher (16th century, Rome)
k = i g i g (k=2)
m = a s h u
c = j y r b
m:=D(k,c)

(3) Rotor Machines (1870-1943)
Eg: Hebern machine (single rotor)
Everytime, one pressing => one nudge
if c is pressed three times, then the machine nudges 3 times..
c pressed first time => i
c pressed second time => g
Like it goes down... the keys are collected.
but, it turns out to be more complicated..
Then....
the most "Enigma" which had 3-5 rotors
rotor position = 26^4 = 2^18
overall keys = 2^36

(4) Data Encryption Standard (DES - 1974)
keys = 2^56, 
block size = 64 bits
DES can be broken through Brute Force attack.

At present, 
-- AES [Advanced Encryption Standards - 128 bits key](2001), 
-- Salsa20(2008)
