Cryptography
-- a great tool
-- provides a base for security mechanisms
-- oh but... but...
(a)it's not a solution to all security issues
Egs: software bugs, social engineering
(b)it's not reliable if not implemented nor used properly
Egs: WEP contains many mistakes in it (Wi-Fi traffic)
(c)Not something to invent
Egs:Broken ad-hoc designs

What can crytography do?

1. Secure communication
Where it occurs?
-- Web Traffic (done through HTTPS...SSL) Hmmm... (o_O)
-- Wireless traffic such as (i)802.11i WPA2, (ii)GSM, (iii)Bluetooth

Explanation:-
Web client --> Web Server
Communication access through HTTPS with the help of SSL/TLS

For SSL/TLS, two main parts are:-
(a) Handshake protocol
-- Establishes shared secret key using public-key cryptography
(will be discussed in detail on Cryptography II)
(b) Record layer
-- Data transmission done using shared secret key
-- Provides confidentiality and integrity
(will be discussed in detail on this Crytography I)

2. File Disk Encryption
-- EFS
-- Truecrypt

Building blocks:-
-- Symmetric Encryption Systems

Users A and B shares a message (m) theough a private key 'k' (128 bits)
The cipher (c) process that is represented as,
E, D : cipher
where E = Encryption, D = Decryption
During encryption, E(k,m)=c
And Decryption as D(k,c)=m
Note:- Encryption algorithm => publicly known.
Never ever think about going for proprietory cipher since it's easy to break.
The only secret lies in the key.

Use cases for keys:-
(a) Single use key --- one-time key
Encrypts one messages
Encrypts one mail and a new key will be generated
For next mail, another new key will be generated
Same key will not be used
(b) Multi use key --- many-time key
Encrypts multiple messages
Same key used in encrypting multiple files
Requires a lot of machinery inorder to make sure that one-time (same) key usage is secure or not

3. Content protection
-- DVDs - CSS (Easy to break)
-- Blu-ray - AACS

4. User authentication
