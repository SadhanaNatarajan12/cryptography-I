Tool used: <code>Git for Windows</code><br>
Language: <code>Python 2.7</code><br>
Python module used: <code>numbthy</code>
```py
## headers -- hints
import sys
import numbthy
```
```
If you don't have Visual Studio and If you don't have .NET framework, then use "numbthy".
No dependencies required.
You can also build your own python module too if you are good in number theory and algebra.
I had no time to build own module since i had some busy boring schedules.

Actually, there is "gmpy2", but it needs Visual Studio and .NET framework.
Because the whole module had been implemented in Visual Studio thingy.
That's why you need those softwares.
```
<b>Execution:
```git
dell@DELL3521 ~
$ cd "/c/python27"

dell@DELL3521 /c/python27
$ python crypto-1/week5/meow.py
```
There comes...the solution! ;)
