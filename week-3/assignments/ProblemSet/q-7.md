<b>Question:</b>
```
Suppose H1 and H2 are collision resistant hash functions mapping inputs in a set M to {0,1}^256. 
Our goal is to show that the function H2(H1(m)) is also collision resistant. 
We prove the contra-positive: suppose H2(H1(.)) is not collision resistant, 
that is, we are given xâ‰ y such that H2(H1(x))=H2(H1(y)). 
We build a collision for either H1 or for H2. 
This will prove that if H1 and H2 are collision resistant then so is H2(H1(.)). 
Which of the following must be true:

(i) Either x,y are a collision for H2 or H1(x),H1(y) are a collision for H1.
(ii) Either x,y are a collision for H1 or x,y are a collision for H2.
(iii) Either x,H1(y) are a collision for H2 or H2(x),y are a collision for H1.
(iv) Either x,y are a collision for H1 or H1(x),H1(y) are a collision for H2.
