<b>Question:</b>
```
Suppose a MAC system (S,V) is used to protect files in a file system by appending a MAC tag to each file. 
The MAC signing algorithm S is applied to the file contents and nothing else. 
What tampering attacks are not prevented by this system?

(i) Changing the last modification time of a file.
(ii) Replacing the contents of a file with the concatenation of two files on the file system.
(iii) Replacing the tag and contents of one file with the tag and contents of a file from another computer protected by the same MAC system, but a different key.
(iv) Changing the first byte of the file contents.
```
<b>Answer:</b>
```
(i) Changing the last modification time of a file.
