<b>Question:</b>
```
Consider the encrypted CBC MAC built from AES. 
Suppose we compute the tag for a long message m comprising of n AES blocks. 
Let m′ be the n-block message obtained from m by flipping the last bit of m 
(i.e. if the last bit of m is b then the last bit of m′ is b xor 1). 
How many calls to AES would it take to compute the tag for m′ from the tag for m and the MAC key? 
(in this question please ignore message padding and simply assume that the message length is always a multiple of the AES block size)

(i) 4
(ii) n
(iii) 5
(iv) 2
