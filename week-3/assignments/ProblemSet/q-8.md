<b>Question:</b>
```
In this question and the next, you are asked to find collisions on two compression functions:
f1(x,y)=AES(y,x) xor y,  and
f2(x,y)=AES(x,x) xor y,
where AES(x,y) is the AES-128 encryption of y under key x. 

We provide an AES function for you to play with. 
The function takes as input a key k and an x value and outputs AES(k,x) once you press the "encrypt" button. 
It takes as input a key k and a y value and outputs AESâˆ’1(k,y) once you press the "decrypt" button. 
All three values k,x,y are assumed to be hex values 
(i.e. using only characters 0-9 and a-f) and the function zero-pads them as needed. 

Your goal is to find four distinct pairs (x1,y1),  (x2,y2),  (x3,y3),  (x4,y4) such that f1(x1,y1)=f1(x2,y2) and f2(x3,y3)=f2(x4,y4). 
In other words, the first two pairs are a collision for f1 and the last two pairs are a collision for f2. 
Once you find all four pairs, please enter them below and check your answer using the "check" button.
