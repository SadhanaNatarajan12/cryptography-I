Factoring challenge #3: (extra credit) 
The following modulus N is a products of two primes p and q where |3p−2q|<N^1/4. 
Find the smaller of the two factors and enter it as a decimal integer. 
Hint: use the calculation below to show that √6N is close to 3p+2q2 and then adapt the method above to factor N.

N = 72006226374735042527956443552558373833808445147399984182665305798191 \
