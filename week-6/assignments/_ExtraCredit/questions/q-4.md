The challenge ciphertext provided below is the result of encrypting a short secret ASCII plaintext using the RSA modulus given in the first factorization challenge. 

The encryption exponent used is e=65537. 

The ASCII plaintext was encoded using PKCS v1.5 before the RSA function was applied,
```
as described in <a href="https://class.coursera.org/crypto-014/lecture/view?lecture_id=58">Lecture 11.4</a>. 
```
Use the factorization you obtained for this RSA modulus to decrypt this challenge ciphertext and enter the resulting English plaintext in the box below. 

Recall that the factorization of N enables you to compute Ï†(N) from which you can obtain the RSA decryption exponent.

After you use the decryption exponent to decrypt the challenge ciphertext you will obtain a PKCS1 encoded plaintext. 

To undo the encoding it is best to write the decrypted value in hex. You will observe that the number starts with a '0x02' followed by many random non-zero digits. 

Look for the '0x00' separator and the digits following this separator are the ASCII letters of the plaintext. 
(note: the separator used here is '0x00', not '0xFF' as stated in the lecture)
