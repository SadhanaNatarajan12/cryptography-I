I'll share the codes later. <br>
I have used Python. Also, tried with Ruby. It works in any language. Some have used Java and Haskell too.
```
In older execution, the coding is correct, but the execution got into problem in the middle.

Already got detected text 1: sifrage
And detected text 2: Ossifrage
```
```
In newer execution, the coding has been re-modified, so, we will get 3 detected texts:

Detected 1: The Magic Words
Detected 2: are Squeamish Os
Detected 3: sifrage

Then, We need to frame it as a sentence...

So.. Duh! We'll get the final decrypted text. :)
```
