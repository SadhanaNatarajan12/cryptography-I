<b>Question:</b>
```
Suppose that using commodity hardware it is possible to build a computer for about $200 that can brute force about 1 billion AES keys per second. 
Suppose an organization wants to run an exhaustive search for a single 128-bit AES key and was willing to spend 4 trillion dollars to buy these machines 
(this is more than the annual US federal budget). 
How long would it take the organization to brute force this single 128-bit AES key with these machines? 
Ignore additional costs such as power and maintenance.

Pick any one choice...
(a) More than a year but less than 100 years
(b) More than a month but less than a year
(c) More than a million years but less than a billion (10^9) years
(d) More than a week but less than a month
(e) More than a billion (10^9) years
```
Answer:<br>
(e) More than a billion (10^9) years. <br>
<br>
Explanation:
```
With reference to problem set 1,
1. Correctly guessing a random 128-bit AES key on the first try.
random 128-bit AES key = 2^128
Max.time    = 2^128 / 2,000,000 keys/second
            = 1.7e + 32 seconds
            = 1.7 X 10^32 keys/second

So, this is for a single random AES key.

For overall set of possibilities...
it will come around [(2^128) X (1.7X10^32)] which will come around more than a billion.
