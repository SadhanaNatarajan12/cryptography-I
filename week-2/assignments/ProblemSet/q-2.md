<b>Question:</b>
```
Suppose that using commodity hardware it is possible to build a computer for about $200 that can brute force about 1 billion AES keys per second. 
Suppose an organization wants to run an exhaustive search for a single 128-bit AES key and was willing to spend 4 trillion dollars to buy these machines 
(this is more than the annual US federal budget). 
How long would it take the organization to brute force this single 128-bit AES key with these machines? 
Ignore additional costs such as power and maintenance.

Pick any one choice...
(a) More than a year but less than 100 years
(b) More than a month but less than a year
(c) More than a million years but less than a billion (10^9) years
(d) More than a week but less than a month
(e) More than a billion (10^9) years
```
