<br> 
Scores:- No. of attempts -- 4/4 <br>

After Attempt #2, i built enough possible solutions scribbling. <br>

<br>
Experience: <br>
Week-2 was little bit difficult for me both in problem set and programming assignment. <br>
I thought that i might quit. But... Duh! I made it through week-2. (^_^)<br>
<br>
// TODO <br>
Need to provide explanations and solutions for the remaining questions and re-modify few of them by the end of the course.
