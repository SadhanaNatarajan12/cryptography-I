Explanation:-
```
1. Correctly guessing a random 128-bit AES key on the first try.
random 128-bit AES key = 2^128
Max.time 	= 2^128 / 2,000,000 keys/second
			= 1.7e + 32 seconds
			= 1.7 X 10^32 keys/second

2. Winning a lottery with 1 million contestants (the probability is 1/10^6 )
Given probability 	= 1/10^6
Max.time 			= 1/10^6 / 2,000,000 keys/second
					= 20^12 keys/second

3. Winning a lottery with 1 million contestants 5 times in a row (the probability is (1/10^6)^5 )
Given probability	= (1/10^6)^5 = 1/10^30
Max.Time for 5 times in a row 
	= (1/10^6)^5 / 2,000,000 keys/seconds
	= 30^12 keys/second

4. Winning a lottery with 1 million contestants 6 times in a row.
Given probability	= (1/10^6)^6 = 1/10^36
Max.Time for 6 times in a row 
	= (1/10^6)^6 / 2,000,000 keys/seconds
	= 36^12 keys/second

5. Winning a lottery with 1 million contestants 7 times in a row.
Given probability	= (1/10^6)^7 = 1/10^42
Max.Time for 7 times in a row 
	= (1/10^6)^7 / 2,000,000 keys/seconds
	= 42^12 keys/second

The lesser the keys hacked in a second, the more time delayed and the lesser the possiblility to win.
The higher the values === the more keys hacked in less time that is more likely to win.

Since, the question is least likely... Arranging it in ascending order..
The choices are as follows (for least likely):- 2, 3, 4, 1, 5
