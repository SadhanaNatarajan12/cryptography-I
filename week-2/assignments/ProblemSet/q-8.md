<b>Question:</b>
```
Recall that encryption systems do not fully hide the length of transmitted messages. 
Leaking the length of web requests has been used to eavesdrop on encrypted HTTPS traffic to a number of web sites, such as tax preparation sites, Google searches, and healthcare sites. 
Suppose an attacker intercepts a packet where he knows that the packet payload is encrypted using AES in CBC mode with a random IV. 
The encrypted packet payload is 128 bytes. Which of the following messages is plausibly the decryption of the payload:

(i)'An enciphering-deciphering machine (in general outline) of my invention has been sent to your organization'
(ii) 'If qualified opinions incline to believe in the exponential conjecture, then I think we cannot afford not to make use of it.'			
(iii) 'We see immediately that one needs little information to begin to break down the process.'			
(iv) 'To consider the resistance of an enciphering process to being broken we should assume that at same times the enemy knows everything but the key being used and to break it needs only discover the key from this information.'
```
Answer: <br>
(i) 'An enciphering-deciphering machine (in general outline) of my invention has been sent to your organization' <br>
<br>
Explanation:
```py
import sys

ig1 = 'To consider the resistance of an enciphering process to being broken we should assume that at same times the enemy knows everything but the key being used and to break it needs only discover the key from this information.'
 
ig2 = 'An enciphering-deciphering machine (in general outline) of my invention has been sent to your organization.' 
 
ig3 = 'We see immediately that one needs little information to begin to break down the process.' 
 
ig4 = 'If qualified opinions incline to believe in the exponential conjecture, then I think we cannot afford not to make use of it.'
 
print len(ig1)
print len(ig2)
print len(ig3)
print len(ig4)
```
```git
Using Git...

dell@DELL3521 ~
$ cd "/c/python27"

dell@DELL3521 /c/python27
$ python crypto-1/week2/payload.py
221
107
88
124
```
```math
Further calculation:-
Step 1: Length of the string (results)
ig1 = 221 bytes
ig2 = 107 bytes
ig3 = 88 bytes
ig4 = 124 bytes
Step 2: After-Padding (results)
ig1 = 226 bytes
ig2 = 112 bytes
ig3 = 93 bytes
ig4 = 129 bytes
Step 3: After-Prepending (results)
ig1 = 242 bytes
ig2 = 128 bytes
ig3 = 109 bytes
ig4 = 145 bytes
Since the target payload is 128 bytes... 
So, the answer is ig2.
ig2 = 'An enciphering-deciphering machine (in general outline) of my invention has been sent to your organization.'
